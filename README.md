#What is this project?
I'm continuing to work with APIs. Today's goal was to build a APOD website that runs via streamlit.
It pulls the astronomy picture of the day from NASA along with the description, and then posts 
it to a website.

<h4>Modules used:</h4>
Streamlit <br />
OS <br />
Requests <br />
